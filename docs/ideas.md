## Future Feature Ideas

Here are some ideas for expanding the functionality of the Dev Dashboard:

*   **Clean Process Stopping:** Instead of just starting processes, provide a way to gracefully stop them. This could involve finding the process ID (PID) and sending a `SIGTERM` or `SIGINT` signal, which is cleaner than just killing the process. This would be especially useful for development servers that don't automatically restart on changes.

*   **Port Finding:** Add a utility to find and list open ports on the system. This could help diagnose issues where a server fails to start because a port is already in use. It could also be used to automatically find a free port for a development server to run on.

*   **Docker Management:** Integrate with Docker to provide a simple interface for managing containers. This could include:
    *   Listing running containers.
    *   Starting and stopping containers.
    *   Viewing container logs.
    *   Running commands inside a container.

*   **Static Code Checks:** Add buttons to run static code analysis tools like linters (e.g., ESLint, RuboCop) and code formatters (e.g., Prettier, Black). This would make it easy to ensure code quality and consistency without having to remember the specific commands.

*   **SSH and Key Management:** Provide a simple interface for managing SSH keys and connecting to remote servers. This could include:
    *   Generating new SSH keys.
    *   Adding SSH keys to the ssh-agent.
    *   Connecting to a remote server via SSH.

*   **Server Deployment:** Add workflows for deploying applications to different environments (e.g., staging, production). This could involve running deployment scripts, building and pushing Docker images, or using tools like `gcloud` or `kubectl` to deploy to a cloud provider.
